 I am learning to write a renderer in C++


### Usage

Compile the source cpp files using (or any method you prefer)

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o main
```

and then generate a image by (the output's in stdout)

```bash
./main > image.ppm
```

then use a [ppm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm#PPM_example) viewer to view the image files
